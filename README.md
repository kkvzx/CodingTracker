# Coding Tracker

### Requirements
- [ ] Should have menu  created with "Spectre Console"
- [ ] Should perform CRUD operations
- [ ] Each class is supposed to be in separate file
- [ ] Configuration file with `connectionStrings` and database path
- [ ] `CodingSession` class with `Id`, `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `Duration`
- [ ] `Duration` should be calculated based on `StartTime` and `EndTime`
- [ ] `Dapper ORM` should be used for the data access.

### Challenges
- Correct architecture and file structure.
I had to research basic application architecture to be able to create maintainable and easy to review code.\ I came across **MVC** pattern that is used in web development.
From **MVC** another pattern for Console/WinForm application emerged which is **MVP**
- I learned on my own skin how important is to change working directory of the project in context of DB creation.
